  abstract    = {Many Android applications encrypt their produced network traffic by default. This prevents malware analysis, because for the differentiation of legitimate apps from malicious ones the decryption of their network traffic is necessary. Mostly TLS is used for network-based encryption. For this reason this paper presents the AndroidTLSInspector, which is an approach for the transparent decryption of an Android app's communication secured by TLS. This is done by network traffic analysis and extraction of the encryption key out of the app's memory. The following paper presents the architecture of this approach and how this approach was implemented. At the end the results of the implementation are presented and further possible research steps are outlined.},
