  abstract    = {The amount of information consumed by the users of mobile services daily is steadily increasing. Due to this, there arises a necessity to present the user only with the information relevant for his current context, which is made possible by location-aware services. This bachelor thesis investigates the possibility of implementation of such services for the improvement of mobile services usability in the context of fitness activities in gym. The research consisted in design and implementation of an application concept in iterative steps with a user-centered approach. The concept allows marking of devices in a gym with Bluetooth beacons to recognize the position of a user in relation to these devices on the base of his proximity to them. Thus it is possible to provide for a device in the gym specific location-aware services. These location-aware services enable the app to select a training device and give access to the detected devices with a minimal number of interactions. This facilitates and accelerates the call of the services. The services include the provision of assistance to inexperienced gym users, as well as the manual recording and displaying of fitness activities in form of statistics, which is also important for more experienced users in the gym. In order to check the usage of the app and the popularity of the supported devices in the gym, an occupancy statistics of the devices supported by the app is also created automatically. Moreover, the app has been developed in such a way that it can be extended with little effort by additional supported devices. This enables a fast implementation of the system in gyms.},
