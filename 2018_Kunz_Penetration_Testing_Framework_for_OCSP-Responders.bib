  abstract    = {Although the reliability of OCSP responders is extremely important for certificate revocation checks in PKIs, no standardized penetration testing solution for them exists yet. Therefore, the focus of this thesis is the search for OCSP's design and implementation related vulnerabilities.
For this purpose a custom black-box fuzzer based on boofuzz is developed. It enables automatic testing of OCSP responders to reveal potential exploitable vulnerabilities using its main generation-based input creation model or its additional mutation-based model. With the fuzzer's monitoring tools the fuzzing run can be monitored and logs are produced for later analysis.
This is successfully tested in a fuzzing campaign, which proofs the applicability of the custom fuzzer on arbitrary OCSP responders. The fuzzing campaign also shows, that the generation-based model is better applicable for a complex protocol like OCSP and it reveals potential exploitable implementation related security vulnerabilities within the audits created for the different targets.},
